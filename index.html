              Bitcoin is a consensus network that enables a new payment system
              and a completely digital money. It is the first decentralized
              peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by its users with no
              central authority or middlemen. From a user perspective, Bitcoin
              is pretty much like cash for the Internet. Bitcoin can also be
              seen as the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in
              existence.

              Bitcoin is the first implementation of a concept called
              "cryptocurrency", which was first described in 1998 by Wei Dai on
              the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of
              money that uses cryptography to control its creation and
              transactions, rather than a central authority.

              Nobody owns the Bitcoin network much like no one owns the
              technology behind email. Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin
              users around the world. While developers are improving the
              software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin protocol
              because all users are free to choose what software and version
              they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users
              need to use software complying with the same rules. Bitcoin can
              only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users.
              Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to
              protect this consensus.

              From a user perspective, Bitcoin is nothing more than a mobile app
              or computer program that provides a personal Bitcoin wallet and
              allows a user to send and receive bitcoins with them. This is how
              Bitcoin works for most users.<br /><br />
              Behind the scenes, the Bitcoin network is sharing a public ledger
              called the "block chain". This ledger contains every transaction
              ever processed, allowing a user's computer to verify the validity
              of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is
              protected by digital signatures corresponding to the sending
              addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending
              bitcoins from their own Bitcoin addresses. In addition, anyone can
              process transactions using the computing power of specialized
              hardware and earn a reward in bitcoins for this service. This is
              often called "mining". To learn more about Bitcoin, you can
              consult the dedicated page and the original paper.

              Bitcoin is designed to allow its users to send and receive
              payments with an acceptable level of privacy as well as any other
              form of money. However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer
              the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves
              extensive public records. Various mechanisms exist to protect
              users' privacy, and more are in development. However, there is
              still work to be done before these features are used correctly by
              most Bitcoin users.
