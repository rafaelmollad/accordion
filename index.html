              Over the years there have been several failed attempts at creating
              a digital currency or cryptocurrency. It started in the late 1980s
              when an unknown computer scientist wanted to help reduce the
              amount of late-night robberies at gas stations, and so trialed
              'smartcards' in which truck drivers could pre-pay their card and
              not have to carry any cash. This proved a success! In 1990 we saw
              Digicash, however, due to over-rapid expansion, the company filed
              bankruptcy in 1998, the same year that PayPal was launched as the
              first digital currency peer-to-peer online payment company. PayPal
              has since gone from strength to strength.
